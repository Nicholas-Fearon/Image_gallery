Assingment Reflection

I implemented all requirements and all stretch requirements. From using "Lighthouse" in the chrome browser I found my finished site to be 98% for Performance and 100% for Accessibility, Best practices and SEO.

I struggled for a few hours when iterating through my for loop. It was giving an error when I went passed my array length. I eventually figured it out. But this took a lot of my time up. When I figured it out, I copied my code in ChatGPT and asked it to explain why it worked. This made my understand the code a lot more.

I think for my next assingment I will plan out what I intend to do first so that I don't get lost in the rabbit hole of creativity. Many hours were lost during this project due to me not having a plan of action in front of me.
